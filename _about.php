            <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 ct-u-paddingBottom40"><p>I started the web development journey back in 2003,
                    at an early age. Since then, I am constantly tackling new and challenging requests, tasks and
                    technologies. For the near future I want to gain more and more experience in the field and create an
                    impressive portfolio over years.<br/><br/>I have a wide range of web development skills, covering
                    both front-end and back-end development.<br/><br/>PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular,
                    jQuery, Bower, Grunt, Elasticsearch, Kibana, WebSockets, RabbitMQ, Laravel, Google Maps API,
                    Braintree Payment and much more. I basically have no limit :)</p></div>
            <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 ct-u-paddingBottom40"><p>I have long-time experience working on Laravel
                    Framework (starting from 3.2 and up to the most recent one) as well as subversioning systems such as
                    GIT and SVN. API integration and API development has never been a hard job for me. I can also assist
                    installing or customizing your WordPress website.<br/><br/>I am fast, responsive and dedicated when
                    it comes to writing great code and delivering on time.<br/><br/>See below some projects I worked on
