                    As a full-stack software engineer, my journey in web development began in 2003, during my early
                    years.<br><br>

                    Over the years, I have encountered many new and challenging situations, tasks, and technologies,
                    which have further honed my skills in this dynamic field.<br><br>

                    Looking ahead, I aspire to continue accumulating rich experiences in web development, and strive
                    towards building a robust portfolio that speaks volumes about my expertise in this domain.<br><br>

                    ⭐ <b>Specialties:</b> PHP, MySQL, Laravel, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch, JS, API development and
                    integrations<br><br>
                    ⭐ <b>Also:</b> Leadership, Remote team management, Agile, Team player, Gitflow, CI
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 ct-u-paddingBottom40">
                <p>
                    I have extensive experience working with Laravel, starting from version 3.2 up to the most recent releases.
                    Custom backend development has always been my strong suit, while building and consuming APIs is second nature to me.<br><br>

                    In addition to my development skills, I can offer <b>consultation</b> on project architecture and platform setup, as well as customization of WordPress websites.<br><br>

                    I am <b>fast</b>, <b>responsive</b> and <b>dedicated</b> when it comes to writing great code and delivering on time.<br><br>
